                         <p class="card-text">Ever since I played my first game, Minecraft Pocket Edition, I was fascinated by the world that showed up on the screen in front of me. 
                         Virtual animals that mooed and walked, creepers and zombies that would chase you, being able to destroy blocks and build giant mansions and code it (redstone) - that all fascinated me and really introduced me to the infinite possibilities of the internet. 
                         Ever since, I have always been wondering how something happens. The logic behind the code. 
                         From games such as Clash Royale and Roblox, as well as watching my dad work behind multiple screens, I knew this was the choice for me. 
                         That is why in the future, I want pursuing a job as a computer science engineer for web development or as a game programmer. I hope to learn the skills to pursue my passions by majoring in computer in college, as well as possibility becoming an intern for companies to build my experience as well.</p>
                         
                         <p class="card-text">Throughout my life, I have constantly been involved and tried out many different activities, many of which I excelled at. 
                         These include choir for 5 years, drawing lessons for 6+ years, tennis, speech and debate, competitive swimming for 8+ years, piano for 8 years, and many more. 
                         If there was one thing that I have learned from all these activities is that you do not learn these skills overnight. 
                         For every charcoal drawing that I finished, there were 10+ hours of painstaking work behind it. 
                         For every race I swam, there were hundreds if not thousands of hours of training behind it.
                         Although many days I didnâ€™t want to do it, whether it'd be sitting down at the piano, entering the pool, steeping up on stage - those all taught me diligence and to never give up.</p>
                         
                         <p class="card-text">These traits also carried over to my school career in Fallon, in which I was one of the top 7 students in terms of grades. 
                         I received straights As for all three years at Fallon, leading to the academic excellence award that only 7 others got. 
                         Additionally, I received the Science Department Award for top student of the year from my science teacher in 8th grade, being 1 out of 3. 
                         Additionally, I competed in many international swim meets, mainly specializing in 100 and 200m/y breast. 
                         I got 3rd place in 200m Breast and 6th place in 100m Breast 2018 Long Course Junior Olympics in Santa Clara.</p>
