                         <p class="card-text">Ever since I played my first game, Minecraft Pocket Edition, 
                         I was fascinated by the world that showed up on the screen in front of me. 
                         Virtual animals that mooed and walked, creepers and zombies that would chase you, 
                         being able to destroy blocks, build giant mansions and even code it (redstone) - 
                         that all fascinated me and really introduced me to the infinite possibilities of the internet. 
                         Ever since, I have always been wondering how something happens. The logic behind the code. 
                         From games such as Clash Royale and Roblox, as well as watching 
                         my dad work behind multiple screens, I knew this was the choice for me. 
                         That is why in the future, I want pursuing a job as a computer science engineer for
                         web development or as a game programmer. I hope to learn the skills to pursue my passions by majoring in computer in college,
                         as well as possibility becoming an intern for companies to build my experience as well.</p>
                         
                         <p class="card-text">Throughout my life, I have constantly been involved in many 
                         different activities. These include choir for 5 years, drawing lessons for 6+ years, tennis, speech and debate, 
                         competitive swimming for 8+ years, piano for 8 years, and many more. 
                         If there was one thing consistant throughout all these activities is that you never learn these skills overnight. 
                         For every charcoal drawing that I finished, there were 10+ hours of painstaking work behind it. 
                         For every race I swam, there were hundreds if not thousands of hours of training behind it.
                         Although many days I did not want to do it, whether it would be sitting down at the piano, jumping in the pool, 
                         steping up on stage - those all taught me diligence and to never give up.</p>
                         
                         <p class="card-text">These traits also carried over to my school career in Fallon, in which I was one of the top 7 students in terms of grades. 
                         I received straights As for all three years in middle school, leading to the academic excellence award. 
                         Additionally, I received the Science Department Award for top student of the year from my science teacher in 8th grade, being 1 out of 3. 
                         I alse competed in many international swim meets, mainly specializing in 100 and 200m/y breast. 
                         I got 3rd place in 200m Breast and 6th place in 100m Breast 2018 Long Course Junior Olympics in Santa Clara.
                         Overall, I am a well-rounded student who is always looking forward to learning new thing. 
                         Thank you for reading and enjoy the rest of my portfolio! </p>
