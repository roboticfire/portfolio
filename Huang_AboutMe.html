                         <p class="card-text" style="margin-top:2%">Ever since I played my first game, Minecraft 
                         Pocket Edition, I was fascinated by the world that showed up on the screen in front
                         of me. Virtual animals that made noises and walked, creepers and zombies that would
                         chase you, being able to destroy blocks and place, building giant mansions and even
                         add code to do certain things — that all fascinated me and introduced me to the
                         infinite possibilities of the internet. Ever since, I have always been wondering
                         about how something happens — the logic behind each action. From games such as
                         Clash Royale and Roblox, as well as watching my dad work behind multiple screens,
                         I knew that engineering is the right choice for me.</p>
                         
                         <p class="card-text">The arts and sports outside of school have also captivated me to
                         explore and learn from the world around me. Throughout my life, I have constantly
                         been interested and involved in many different activities. These include choir, drawing
                         lessons, tennis, speech and debate, robotics, competitive swimming for 9+ years, piano for 
                         9+ years, and many more. If there was one thing that I learned from all these activities is
                         that you never learn these skills overnight. Behind every charcoal drawing that I finished,
                         there were 10+ hours of painstaking work behind it. For every race I swam, there were 
                         hundreds if not thousands of hours of rigorous training behind it. For countless days I 
                         wanted to give up – but I didn’t. Whether it would be sitting down at the piano, jumping 
                         in the pool, or stepping up on stage - all those little moments taught me diligence and to 
                         never give up.</p>
                         
                         <p class="card-text">These traits also carried over to my school career, where I strive to 
                         be the best I can every day. To pursue my goal as a software engineering, I have joined
                         many clubs and activities dedicated to engineering. For example, recently, I have 
                         joined Gael Force Robotics, a student-run high school club whose members work on both 
                         real-life engineering projects and participate in the VEX Robotics Competition. 
                         Additionally, I am now a part of DEDA, the Dublin Engineering and Design Academy, 
                         where I learn engineering skills through courses such as Principles of Engineering and 
                         Computer Science Principles. Through these classes, I have learned engineering skills 
                         such as building and designing (POE), as well as programming (CSP). I am currently 
                         proficient in Java, Python, HTML, CSS, and Netlogo. Overall, I am a well-rounded student
                         who is always looking forward to learning new things. Thank you for reading and enjoy
                         the rest of my portfolio!</p>
