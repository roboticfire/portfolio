                                   <p class="text-left">For this project, our group was tasked with designing and coding an educational
                                        game. We created a brainstorming list where we evaluated different games to modify such as space 
                                        invaders, the snake game, solitaire, and many others. Then, our group used a decision matrix to 
                                        decide on which game as well as what topic to teach. As everyone in my group was enrolled in AP Calc 
                                        AB, we wanted to create a fun game where people would be able to pratice their derivation skills. Thus,
                                        using Java and Greenfoot, our group created a modified version of space invaders. Some challenges 
                                        that our group faced were creating the question cycling system, working with the GUI, and merging
                                        code from 4 different people and making sure there were no merge conflicts. I learned a lot from 
                                        this project such as code management/merging, delegating tasks to according to one's strengths/weaknesses,
                                        threading, and how a bug that seems really simple can take a lot of time and effort to fix. Overall, this 
                                        was a great learning experience and I am proud of everything I accomplished.</p>

                                   <h5><strong>Type of Project</strong> - Individual </h5>
                                   <p class="text-left">For this project, I was tasked with creating a simulation in Java that mimics something
                                        that could happen in real life. I first started out by brainstorming possible ideas such as a rocket
                                        simulator, planet simulator, race simulator, or a shooting simulator. While all of these were viable 
                                        options, I chose to go with the shooting simulator since it seemed the most funny to both make and play. 
                                        The game works with enemies spawning on the sides of the map the user's goal is to shoot all of the 
                                        enemies before they reach the player. There were many problems I faced when creating this game such as 
                                        phasing through blocks, double jumping, acceleration due to gravity when falling, and object collision.
                                        While I did have experience with creating games, I had to dive deep into the Greenfoot documentation 
                                        to fully understand how the logic worked. This project taught me how to write scalable and differentiable
                                        code, since I took the initiative to make the code as clean and organized as possible. This was 
                                        because the project contraints themselves were extremely simple, so I decided to push myself so
                                        that I could learn something. I learned a lot in regard to object-oriented programming and I am very 
                                        happy with this project in general.</p>

                                   <h5><strong>Type of Project</strong> - 4 Person Group </h5>
                                   <p class="text-left">For this project, our group was tasked with designing and building a 
                                        projectile made entirely out of paper. After the projectile was made, it would then be
                                        attached to a pressurized PVC pipe which would then launch it through the air. To create
                                        the body of the plane, I used rolled up printer paper reinforced with 3 layers of tape
                                        for a light, yet rigid body. My initial design was a glider that had paper wings with
                                        manila supports and a pressure cap made out of manila as well. However, I soon realized
                                        that a glider was not the optimal design for a pressurized air launcher. This was
                                        because the addition of large wings introduces a large margin of error that can 
                                        stem from the turbulence during the launch, which will almost always make the glider 
                                        spin in a spiral. As a result, I decided to go with a standard rocket with a long body
                                        and small trapezoidal fins. My new projectile had a 14.8-inch body (15-inch limit)
                                        to maximize its initial speed on launch. The choice of trapezoidal fins meant that
                                        there was not a significant amount of drag, but it still provided both high stability
                                        and rigidity — something essential to maintaining the ideal arc. I chose to go with
                                        relatively small fins as I knew that the projectile would be in a spiral, so thus 
                                        wanted to limit the amount of momentum loss by the fins, but at the same time I 
                                        still wanted enough resistance to maintain stability and reduce yaw movement. My 
                                        second rocket was pretty close to the theoretical horizontal displacement (354 ft vs
                                        353.7 ft) due to its sleek design which limited the effect air resistance had on it.
                                        There was still some deviation which could be attributed to slight yaw movement
                                        from the small fins. Although the fins were small and didn’t have that much 
                                        drag, it was a tradeoff between stability and drag. This is because there isn’t
                                        a lot of problems it faces when it comes into contact with external factors, such
                                        as wind. The projectile is designed for distance and maintaining the ideal path
                                        — something that it does well. Some modifications for future flights could be
                                        the addition of a weighted cone to further shift the center of mass forward, 
                                        reduce drag on the body through better taping (no air bubbles), and fine-tuning fins
                                        to reduce drag but also to maximize stability. You can view the daily project log

                                        <h5><strong>Type of Project</strong> - 4 Person Group </h5>
                                        <p class="text-left">For this project, our group was tasked with creating a vehicle 
                                        using either VEX or Fisher Tech parts that would run on either hydrogen fuel 
                                        cells or solar fuel cells. The vehicle was required to fit within a certain 
                                        parameter (5 x 12 inch), and be able to securely hold both the fuel cells and 
                                        the breadboard when moving. For the best configuration, I decided to use a 
                                        parallel circuit with 2 solar cells that would supply power to our VEX 393 motor,
                                        which would then turn a 1 : 6 sprocket system that provides the vehicle with more
                                        speed at the expense of torque. The goal of this project was to provide insight
                                        to a fictitious company in regard to the capabilities of the two energy sources,
                                        which supported through a series of tests involving a force measurer, timer, multimeter,
                                        and a meter stick. After the vehicle was fully built, a series of tests were run to determine
                                        the input power (I x V) and the output power (W / T) to thus determine the efficiency of the
                                        system. Our vehicle had the fastest time out of all the other vehicles in our course, 
                                        taking only 2.82 seconds to travel 1 meter. My personal role in this project was building 
                                        the vehicle, as well as modifying certain parts to maximize efficiency. For example, due to 
                                        the size constraints, our original idea did not work as it would be too wide. As a result, I 
                                        designed and built a solution of attaching standoffs to the top of the vehicle in order to mount
                                        the solar cells and the breadboard. Additionally, I worked on the actual frame of the 
                                        vehicle as well. I personally built the chassis, as the motor mount, the sprocket system 
                                        for driving the wheel, and modified other aspects of the vehicle to maximize efficiency.

                                        learned a lot from the process.</p>

                                   <h5><strong>Type of Project</strong> - 2 Person Group </h5>
                                   <p class="text-left">For this project, our group was tasked with manipulating images 
                                   based on the expectations of a fake client. Our client was family, and they wanted 
                                   to a border and text, and many user options. As this was a relatively simple task, 
                                   I decided to experiment with different methods to go above and beyond. As a result, 
                                   I created many different user options that they could do, such as having 2 separate
                                   borders (striped diagonally or striped vertically and horizontally), tinting the image
                                   , having the user choose a border size, choosing the border color, choosing the text 
                                   color, and many more. Some of the issues that were faced was simply knowing how the 
                                   libraries (PIL) worked. However, after doing a lot of research, experimentation, and 
                                   brainstorming, I managed to get the paste, tint, and user_input() function to work 
                                   together. I learned that no matter how hard something may seem at first if the will 
                                   is there, there is a way it can be done. Additionally, I learned the importance of
                                   clean and documented code, as it made it significantly easier to troubleshoot issues.
                                   Troubleshooting skills were also obtained by adding breakpoints in certain lines of
                                   code, in order to see what the different images looked like (border images with a pattern
                                   tinted image, resized image, etc). Overall, this was a very fun project and I am proud of
                                   what I learned and accomplished.</p>

                                   <h5><strong>Type of Project</strong> - 2 Person Group </h5>
                                   <p class="text-left">For this project, the game that our group worked on was Mole Mash. 
                                   In the original, unedited version, a mole pops up at a random position on the screen
                                   and the player scores points by hitting the mole before it jumps away. My partner and 
                                   I explored and added bonus features to make the game more intriguing such as a life system,
                                   levels, timers, start/instructions screen, a cloud saving score, obstacles, and many more. 
                                   In this project, I mainly did the programming as well as leave comments on my code which helped 
                                   tremendously when troubleshooting problems such as overlapping moles/obstacles, screen errors, and lag. 
                                   In this project, I learned how hard it is to get the perfect code right away as a few typos or contradictions 
                                   could ruin and crash your game. This helped me establish a great foundation of leaving comments, troubleshooting 
                                   code, and patience (the longest bug to find was 2 days). Additionally, this experience taught me the importance of 
                                   teamwork and communication as a team and that two brains are always better than one. Having more than one 
                                   person look over code helps gives another perspective on to how to approach a problem. Overall, the project
                                   went pretty well and I am happy with how it turned out.</p>
