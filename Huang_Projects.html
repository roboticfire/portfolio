                                        <h5><strong>Course</strong> - Principles of Engineering</h4>
                                        <h5><strong>Objective</strong> - To design and construct a vehicle that can travel 1 meter using hydrogen or solar energy</h5>
                                        <h5><strong>Type of Project</strong> - 4 Person Group </h5>
                                        <p class="text-left">For this project, our group was tasked with manipulating images 
                                        based on the expectations of a fake client. Our client was family, and they wanted 
                                        to a border and text, and many user options. As this was a relatively simple task, 
                                        I decided to experiment with different methods to go above and beyond. As a result, 
                                        I created many different user options that they could do, such as having 2 separate
                                        borders (striped diagonally or striped vertically and horizontally), tinting the image
                                        , having the user choose a border size, choosing the border color, choosing the text 
                                        color, and many more. Some of the issues that were faced was simply knowing how the 
                                        libraries (PIL) worked. However, after doing a lot of research, experimentation, and 
                                        brainstorming, I managed to get the paste, tint, and user_input() function to work 
                                        together. I learned that no matter how hard something may seem at first if the will 
                                        is there, there is a way it can be done. Additionally, I learned the importance of
                                        clean and documented code, as it made it significantly easier to troubleshoot issues.
                                        Troubleshooting skills were also obtained by adding breakpoints in certain lines of
                                        code, in order to see what the different images looked like (border images with a pattern
                                        tinted image, resized image, etc). Overall, this was a very fun project and I am proud of
                                        what I learned and accomplished.</p>

                                   <h5><strong>Course</strong> - Computer Science Principles</h4>
                                   <h5><strong>Objective</strong> - Implement new features to a certain game using MIT App Inventor </h5>
                                   <h5><strong>Type of Project</strong> - 2 Person Group </h5>
                                   <p class="text-left">For this project, the game that our group worked on was Mole Mash. 
                                   In the original, unedited version, a mole pops up at a random position on the screen
                                   and the player scores points by hitting the mole before it jumps away. My partner and 
                                   I explored and added bonus features to make the game more intriguing such as a life system,
                                   levels, timers, start/instructions screen, a cloud saving score, obstacles, and many more. 
                                   In this project, I mainly did the programming as well as leave comments on my code which helped 
                                   tremendously when troubleshooting problems such as overlapping moles/obstacles, screen errors, and lag. 
                                   In this project, I learned how hard it is to get the perfect code right away as a few typos or contradictions 
                                   could ruin and crash your game. This helped me establish a great foundation of leaving comments, troubleshooting 
                                   code, and patience (the longest bug to find was 2 days). Additionally, this experience taught me the importance of 
                                   teamwork and communication as a team and that two brains are always better than one. Having more than one 
                                   person look over code helps gives another perspective on to how to approach a problem. Overall, the project
                                   went pretty well and I am happy with how it turned out.</p>
