                              <p class="card-text" style="margin-top:2%">During my time in the engineering program, I have met
                                    a number of industry professionals through workplace field trips and guest speakers who have
                                   inspired me through hands-on experiences as well as a glimpse into daily lives. These experiences
                                   have revealed new career paths that I never knew existed and helped me get a better grasp on
                                   what I want to do in the future. Additionally, through question and answer sessions, they
                                   have also shaped my academic path and shown me the steps I need to take to reach my dream 
                                   of being a software engineer.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p class="card-text">One of the field trips that stood out to me was the trip to Patriots Jet Team
                                   Foundation where I was able to get a closer look at the logistics and engineering 
                                   behind a successful airshow. When I saw my first airshow as a child, I had always thought
                                   that it would be a relatively easy task to accomplish. However, our guide, a current show
                                   pilot, revealed many interesting things that I didn’t know before about the composition 
                                   of the plane. For example, there were the smoke system, the horizontal and vertical 
                                   stabilizers, elevators, fuel tanks, and rudder, many had to be modified for supersonic 
                                   speeds. Additionally, other factors such as pressure, temperature, and humidity would also
                                   have to be taken into account when performing an airshow, which was something I had never 
                                   taken into consideration before.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p class="card-text">In addition to field trips, I also got the opportunity to talk to many industry
                                   professionals, with one particularly interesting person being Jason from Uber. Jason worked
                                   on Uber’s self-driving cars program and went into detail about how machine learning and 
                                   advancements in technology will guide the future. Everything in the world runs on data, and 
                                   by processing that data, many incredible things can be accomplished. Jason explained how 
                                   his machine learning classification model worked with its neural network and how it processes
                                   large quantities of data to classify images and entities through its sensors. From both a
                                   hardware and software standpoint, many teams of engineers worked together and collaborated
                                   to develop an efficient and safe car which will go on to save the lives of many people in
                                   the future by preventing car accidents.
